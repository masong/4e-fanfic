To get certs up and running:

1) Follow the first step from this page â€“ it will walk you through the creation of a new certificate
  1a) Download the MIT CA certificate from https://ca.mit.edu/mitca.crt and copy it to /etc/ssl/
2) Run gem install passenger
3) Go and download the nginx source code
4) Run sudo passenger-install-nginx-module. Select the option to customize your installation, and give it the directory where you downloaded the source code to. Use the default for where you want to install Nginx to. When asked for extra agruments, provide '--with-http_ssl_module'
5) Setup /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf to be similar to the provided conf file
6) Start nginx with 'sudo /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx'
7) Install thin with 'gem install thin'
8) cd into the fanfic directory, start thin with thin start -s3 -p 3000


Nginx takes care of the certificate authentication, adds some information to the http header, then fowards the requset to the thin server on port 3000.
